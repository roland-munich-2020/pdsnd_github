### Bikeshare project

### Description
In this project I wrote a python script which lets the user evaluate bikeshare data from three cities in the US.
The data was provided by Motivate and is from 2017.
I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
The script takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

#### Statistics Computed
The descriptive statistics computed are the following:

##### 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

##### 2 Popular stations and trip
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

##### 3 Trip duration
* total travel time
* average travel time

##### 4 User info
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
I used the following data files with bikeshare data:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
